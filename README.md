# Feed Reader Testing Project

## Ways to Develop:
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository to your machine *you will need a code editor*
3. Download the ZIP file and open the .html file from your file explorer in your favorite browser

## Description
The hypothetical scenario is that I took over for another developer after she left my organization in the middle of writing test suites for a project in development, a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I was tasked with picking up where she left off and needed to finish writing the test suites.

## Project Requirements
*The project challenge was to write suites to test the following:*
- Ensure RSS feeds are defined
- Ensure RSS feeds have defined URLs that are not empty
- Ensure RSS feeds have defined names and are not empty
- Ensure the menu is hidden by default
- Ensure the menu is visible when the menu icon is clicked and hidden when clicked a second time
- Ensure the internal entries have at least one feed when the LoadFeed function is called and completed
- Ensure the new feed selection actually changes content via the LoadFeed function

## How I completed the project:
- I completed the project with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, Jasmine


- Wrote the test suites for 'RSS Feeds' and verified passing
- Wrote the test suites for 'The Menu' and verified passing
- Wrote the test suites for 'Internal Entries' and verified passing
- Wrote the test suites for 'New Feed Selection' and verified passing
